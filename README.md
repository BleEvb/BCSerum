#BCSerum #SkinCare #BattleOfTheVitaminCSerums

This is a mini project called BCSerum abbreviated for Battle of C Serums.

I compared 5 Vitamin C serums with different prices but high ratings. I used Python, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, a data visulation library built on top of matplotlib for the graphics.

I used a dataset with a list of multiple skin care (e.g. face creams, serums, face scrubs) and picked out a few high ratings of Vitamin C Serums to compare for this project.
